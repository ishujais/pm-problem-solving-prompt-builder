# PM Problem Solving Prompt Builder for Interviews

An interactive tool designed to help Product Managers develop strong problem-solving skills for interviews.

This is not a framework cheat sheet.  
It is a thinking trainer.

---

## The Problem

After multiple PM interviews, one pattern became clear, most candidates don’t fail because they don’t know frameworks.
They fail because they:

- Jump to solutions too fast  
- Define vague metrics ("improve engagement")  
- Don’t dig deep into the problem  
- Skip user segmentation  
- Avoid trade-offs  
- Speak structured… but think shallow  

PM interviews test thinking under ambiguity. This tool was built to train that muscle.

## What This Tool Does

The Prompt Builder helps you generate a **customized master coaching prompt** that turns any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) into:

- A strict PM interviewer  
- A metrics coach  
- A root cause analyst  
- A product sense evaluator  
- A strategic case study reviewer  

You select:

✔ Weak areas (Problem digging, Metrics, Root Cause, Prioritization, etc.)  
✔ Interview type (Product Sense, Execution, Strategy, Estimation)  
✔ Coaching depth (Guided / Coaching Mode / Strict Interviewer)

It generates a structured prompt you paste into an LLM to simulate real interview pressure.

##  Why This Is Different

Most PM prep content gives you:

- Framework lists  
- Sample answers  
- Templates to memorize  

This tool forces you to:

- Clarify before solving  
- Quantify assumptions  
- Define North Star & guardrail metrics  
- Present trade-offs  
- Think in systems  
- Justify prioritization  
- Connect product decisions to business impact  

It trains how you think, not what you say.
